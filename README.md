# Movie Recommendation System

A Django-based **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on user preferences.  
This project is containerized with **Docker** for easy setup and deployment.  

---

##  Project Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** uses **content-based filtering** to suggest movies that are similar to a selected movie.  
It matches movie similarity based on metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.  

The backend is built using **Django**, and the frontend uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The system can run locally or inside a **Docker container** for easy deployment.
